# Implementation Log: Bug - Sidebar Navigation Active State

## Timestamp: 2025-11-06

### Steps 1-5 Completed
- Removed duplicate Tenders nav item (was pointing to same route as Home)
- Fixed navItems definitions with explicit match functions:
  - Home: active only on `/projects` (exact match)
  - Company: active only on `/settings` (exact match)
  - Team: active only on `/settings/team` (exact match)
  - Billing: active only on `/settings/billing` (exact match)
  - Settings: active on `/settings/documents` and other `/settings/*` routes (excluding team/billing)
- Refactored isActive function to use only custom match functions with fallback to exact match
- Removed complex conditional logic that caused overlapping active states
- Cleaned up unused FileText import
- Files changed: 1 (components/sidebar.tsx)

### Summary
Fixed sidebar navigation bug by:
1. Eliminating duplication (removed Tenders nav item)
2. Adding explicit match functions to all nav items for precise route matching
3. Simplifying isActive logic to prevent multiple items showing active simultaneously
4. Each route now maps to exactly one active nav item with no overlaps

### Build Status
- ESLint autofix applied successfully (import sorting)
- Pre-existing TypeScript error found in app/api/projects/[id]/export/route.ts (unrelated to sidebar changes)
- Sidebar component compiles without errors
