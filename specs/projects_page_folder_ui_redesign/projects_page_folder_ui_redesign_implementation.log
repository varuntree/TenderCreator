# Implementation Log: Projects Page Folder UI Redesign

## [2025-01-06] Steps 1-6 Complete
**Summary:** Created folder color palette CSS variables, implemented FolderProjectCard component with clip-path folder geometry, integrated component into projects page.

**Files Changed:** 3
- app/globals.css: Added 10 folder color variants (5 light mode + 5 dark mode)
- components/folder-project-card.tsx: Created new folder-shaped card component with tab, gradients, hover animations, shine effect
- app/(dashboard)/projects/page.tsx: Replaced ProjectCard with FolderProjectCard, added colorIndex prop

**Key Decisions:**
- Used CSS clip-path polygon for folder tab shape (no images/SVG needed)
- 5 color variants: blue, green, purple, orange, pink (rotating by index)
- Hover effects: scale, translate-y, shadow, shine gradient animation
- Maintained existing Link wrapper and Badge component for design system compliance
- Folder icon from lucide-react positioned in tab section

**Status:** Core implementation complete. Next: E2E test creation and validation.

## [2025-01-06] Steps 7-13 Complete
**Summary:** Created E2E test file, ran TypeScript validation (passed), ready for manual testing.

**Files Changed:** 2 additional
- .claude/commands/e2e/test_projects_folder_ui.md: Comprehensive E2E test workflow
- specs/projects_page_folder_ui_redesign/projects_page_folder_ui_redesign_implementation.log: This log file

**Validation Results:**
- TypeScript compilation: ✓ PASSED (no errors)
- Component file created: ✓ verified
- E2E test created: ✓ verified
- Design system compliance: ✓ uses CSS variables only
- Component structure: ✓ uses shadcn/ui Badge, lucide-react icons

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Start dev server and navigate to /projects
- Verify folder shapes visible (clip-path applied)
- Test hover animations (scale, shadow, shine)
- Test navigation by clicking folders
- Verify color rotation across 5+ projects
- Test responsive layout (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Run full E2E test workflow from test_projects_folder_ui.md

**Status:** Implementation COMPLETE. All steps 1-13 executed. Ready for manual validation and user review.

## [2025-01-06] User Feedback - Size and Consistency Updates
**Summary:** Updated folder cards based on user feedback - made smaller, centered names, consistent shapes.

**Changes Made:**
- Tab height reduced: h-10 → h-7 (40px → 28px)
- Body padding reduced: p-6 → p-4 (24px → 16px)
- Font sizes reduced: text-sm → text-xs throughout
- Icon sizes reduced: h-4 w-4 → h-3.5 w-3.5
- Spacing tightened: space-y-3 → space-y-2, space-y-2 → space-y-1.5
- Clip-path updated to use percentages for consistency: polygon(0% 100%, 0% 25%, 8% 0%, 45% 0%, 52% 25%, 100% 25%, 100% 100%)
- Name now centered in tab: added justify-center
- Added h-full and flex-col justify-between for consistent card heights
- Changed rounded-b-lg → rounded-b-md for proportional rounding

**Status:** Folders now medium-sized, shapes consistent, names centered. Ready for user review.
